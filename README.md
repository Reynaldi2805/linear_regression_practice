# Ride-Hailing Price Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on creating regression models to predict ride-hailing prices using the provided dataset. The main objective is to develop accurate models that can estimate the fare for rides on a ride-hailing platform based on various factors. Two regression models, Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor, have been implemented and evaluated to compare their performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of Uber and Lyft transaction data, which includes relevant information such as ride distance, duration, time of day, and fare amount.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: Programming language used for development.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used for building the Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor models.
- **pandas**: Data manipulation library used for handling and preprocessing the dataset.
- **numpy**: Library used for numerical computations and array operations.
- **scipy**: Library used for scientific and technical computing tasks.
- **pickle**: Library used for serializing and deserializing Python object structures.
- **json**: Library used for encoding and decoding JSON data.

## Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to prepare it for modeling.
2. **Feature Selection**: Identified relevant features that could influence the ride-hailing prices.
3. **Model Development**: Built a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn to predict ride fares. Additionally, a Decision Tree Regressor model was implemented.
4. **Model Comparison**: Evaluated and compared the performance of the Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor models.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the models' performance using appropriate metrics to assess accuracy and reliability.
